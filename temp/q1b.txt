I ran gdb using info files I found that libc was loaded between 0xb7d672c0 and 0xb7d87e74 so I ran a search `find 0xb7d672c0, 0xb7d87e74, "/bin/sh"` and found 1 pattern at 0xb7d7e82b. Then using `print system` I found that system is located at 0xb7c5dda0 and using what I found out in q1a (the location of the return address after the buffer) I entered 0xb7c5dda0 as the return address, then a padding of 4 'a's to act as the "return address" (that will actually make the program crash upon exiting the shell) finally followed by the address of "/bin/sh" (0xb7d7e82b) as an argument for system  as the return address.
