So I took inspiration from slide 12 of recitation 7, and because Bob implements the execution and Alice the validation there is mismatch between what is validated and what is exectued. namely, Alice uses json.load() to read the file while Bob uses the read() and it turns out that they return the data in different order that is json.load() reads from the end of the string while read() from the begining. Because of that, when I write command A and then the signature of command B and then  command B it turns out that the validation is done on command B and not on command A BUT command A is executed! So the generate_exploit method in q4.py returns:
{"command": "echo hacked", "signature": "007152ab1a65e9e864928d0f5cc6f47e8ce6217c09f7e7518d3d15f901e33df7e4bd760e2538929bdf2c5bf710b2babbcb2f268f458551ecbee78df22f3bb039696a2fccf58ccdeeb0c235e36593aa4b8be3d62e4ae6a59f6aebf78e3aec5b1685672bff191969731a096fa8f9ef29926bbee303d0673482410a25d00c46bdc1", "command" : "echo cool"}
