Using this filter 'http.request.method == "POST"' I filtered the HTTP POST packet from the rest.

In q1.py's method packet_filter(packet) I first verified that the transport layer protocol is TCP and that the port matches the application layer protocol of HTTP. Next I resolved the IP address of infosec17.cs.tau.ac.il and then verified that the packets' destination address agrees with the resolved IP and finally I cheched if the packet has a TCP payload (i.e. made sure its lenght is > 0).

In q1.py's parse_packet(packet) I called the urlparse.parse_qs on the load field of the TCP layer of the packet and then extracted those from the dictionary that returned.
