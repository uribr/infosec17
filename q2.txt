I've begun by writing a client in C that does exacly what my shallcode should do, then I compiled it and looked at its disassembly using IDA.

Next, I searched the server program disassembly using IDA for the addresses of functions that were used by the client I worte.

Finally, I wrote my own shellcode using the client program disassemly as reference adjusting it to my own needs.

Using q1.py I found out the beginning of the buffer and the location of the return address and adjusted in q2.py I added a NOP slide that guarantees that the size of the message will bring us right to the return address location.

In q2.py I calculated the middle of hte NOP slide using the beginning of the buffer and the size of the NOP slide and appending that address to the end of the payload.

I think the shellcode includes enought comments that writing anything mroe about it here will just be repeating myself.
