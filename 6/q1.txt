For the payload that gets the pid I used 'pgrep antivirus' which returns the pid of the process whose name is antivirus.
In the get_antivirus_pid I simply retunred the prodcut (a single pid).
And finally in q1.py get_payload I returned the kill command with the pid (casted to a string): return 'kill -9 ' + str(pid)
