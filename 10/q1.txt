In the login function of the server a cookie is created from the base64 encoding of the username.
Using 'edward'.ecnode('base64') and setting the login cookie to this value will make it appear as if we are logged in as edward.
The vulnerability is in the login_required function that upon receiveing a cookie simply verifies is there is a user whose username, encoded in base64, matches that cookie.
The cookie is therefore deterministic and predictable if the username is known.
