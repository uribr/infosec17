By exploiting the /join command to create a piece of HTMl that will be visible to all currently and futurely logged in users I get my <script> </script> to run at all active users and users that will log after the creation of the new channel. Inside the script I dynamically swap channels to #general-spam, fill out the text area with "Good Morning" and call the PostMessage() method.
