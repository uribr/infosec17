By exploiting the /rename command to to perform an SQL Injection, closing the SQL gracefuly I then rename the #nsk-home channel to hold a JS script which sends a message contaitnig "Good Morning" to the general-spam channel using the beginning of the PostMessage function. Finally I add non-SQL characters (Namely, "CYBERNINJA") so that the server won't post the rename post which makes the attack more steahly, altough it causes an internal server error which hopefuly no one will notice (but a message about renaming is definitley logged so I decided that an internal server error is less obvious than a post).
