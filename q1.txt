The server's read_data function does not check if the size of the data read so far has exceeded the size of the buffer and not does the handle_connection function check that the size of the incoming data fits in the buffer. Thus, by sending a very large amount of data we will cause a buffer overflow, which will cause the server to receive a segmentation fault if we overwrote some critical data that is located after the buffer.
