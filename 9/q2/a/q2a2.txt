Using the key 'Valar Morghulis!' and os.urandom() to generate an iv winston.py padds the message 'I love you' + '\0' padded to be a multiple of 16 with the padding length is encrypted and sent over to julia.py, who receives the encrypted message and then takes the first 16 bytes as iv for the decryption and decrypts the rest of the ciphertext (past the first 16 bytes) and thanks to the '\0' the padding is filtered.
