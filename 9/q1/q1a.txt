Creating a SYN TCP\IP packet using scapy for each of the ports that were passed and trying to send it (and wait for timeout seconds for an answer).
According to the answer (if there is any) we decide to tag it as a filtered port, an open port or a closed port.

It is called a stealth SYN scan because no logging of communication is done before a TCP\IP connection is fully established (i.e. 3-way handshake) which means our SYN packets don't create fully-fledged connections and thus leave no trace (the connection attempt won't appear in the applications' logs, probably). Furthermore, there is no way to differentiate a malicious syn scan packet and a benevolent syn packet whose next Ack packet (that seals the 3-way handshake) simply lost its way or that the sender for some reason terminated the connection abruptly and thus it is impossible to know if a syn packet is malicious or benevolent.
