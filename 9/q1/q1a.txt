Creating a SYN TCP\IP packet using scapy for each of the ports that were passed and trying to send it (and wait for timeout seconds for an answer).
According to the answer (if there is any) we decide to tag it as a filtered port, an open port or a closed port.

It is called a stealth SYN scan because no logging of communication is done before a TCP\IP connection is fully established (i.e. 3-way handshake) which means our SYN packets don't create fully-fledged connections and thus leave no trace (the connection attempt won't appear in the applications' logs, probably).
