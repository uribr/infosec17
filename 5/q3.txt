After creating libc.bin as instructed I used IDA to find where auth is kept in memory (0x0804A054) and the original return address from check_password (0x080488C6). Then I manually checked what for a 'pop {0}; pop {1}' gadget so that one register will hold the address and one will hold the value to be written. Then I searched for a 'mov [{0}], {1}' gadget and found one that mathces the pop gadget and addedd a dynamic search for these two gadgets 'pop ecx; pop eax' and 'mov [eax], ecx' into q3.py. Finally I constructed the string that will server as input to sudo with appropriate padding of legnth OFFSET(=66).
